# TINY-WEATHER-STATION-USING-RASPBERRY-Pi-4
This project involves the development of an IoT-based weather station utilizing a Raspberry Pi 4, DHT11, and BMP180 sensors using python such that the system collects real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, and displays the information on a local interface or web dashboard. \
We use ThingSpeak to monitor the data and monitor it using the following link: https://thingspeak.mathworks.com/channels/2799054

In Conclusion:
This project successfully demonstrates the design and implementation of an IoT-based weather station using a Raspberry Pi, DHT11, and BMP180 sensors. By collecting and displaying temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, the system provides valuable environmental data for a variety of applications. The project is modular and can be enhanced with additional features such as more sensors, solar power integration, or advanced data analytics.
Future scope includes deploying the system in remote locations for autonomous weather monitoring, integrating with machine learning models for predictive weather analysis, and connecting to smart home systems for automated climate control.
