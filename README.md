# TINY-WEATHER-STATION-USING-RASPBERRY-Pi-4
This project involves the development of an IoT-based weather station utilizing a Raspberry Pi 4, DHT11, and BMP180 sensors using python such that the system collects real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, and displays the information on a local interface or web dashboard.
